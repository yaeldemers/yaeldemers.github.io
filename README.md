This is the repository of my tech portfolio. It showcases a couple of my latest coding projects.

This website was build using Bootstrap in Visual Studio Code.

It is a modified / stylised version of the Grayscale template from StartBootstrap [StartBootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) under a [MIT License](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-grayscale/blob/master/LICENSE).

Cheers!
